My Vim setup
============

My Vim setup. Currently optimized for Python 3, with some consideration for HTML and JavaScript.

Plugins used:
nerdcommenter
rainbow parentheses
snipmate
syntastic
fugitive
repeat
surround

and the solarized colour scheme.

It also contains my vimrc, which doesn't have anything interesting in yet.
